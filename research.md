Why do we like some songs and hate others? Why do we spend money to visit art galleries? Why do we spend so much time binge-watching the latest TV show? My research wants to tackle these and many other questions about the pleasure we take in and the decisions we make based on sensory experiences. To say it in fancy words: The main focus of my research is aesthetic value -- the value we assign to sensory experiences. My PhD thesis encompasses a series of studies on the experience of beauty, trying to understand this unique experience from a psychological, experimental and quantitative perspective. My current work follows up on these efforts and now takes a more encompassing view both in terms of its subject (going from beauty to aesthetic value broadly conceived) and its methodology (now also incorporating computational neuroscience, machine- and reward-learning perspectives).

My approach to studying beauty is **quantitative** and **computational**. During my PhD, I started to develop a (mostly descriptive) mathematical working model of the processes underlying an experience of beauty. As a postdoc, I want to use this new perspective on beauty to finally integrate an understanding of aesthetic value into how we think about human judgment and decision making.

I also aim to make my approach interdisciplinary by collaborating with philosophers like Joerg Fingerhut and Angelica Nuzzo.

**A computational model of aesthetic value.** Can we build a computational model that predicts what image people want to look at, how long, and at what cost? Well, we think so. Our model is inspired by fluency and predictive coding accounts of aesthetic appreciation. It integrates both views and builds on established reward-learning algorithms. In a nutshell, we suggest that aesthetic value is comprised of two reward components: an immediate one related to how well the current object is processed, and one that is related to the expected increase in how well future objects will be processed.

**How much would you pay for beauty?** Can we translate aesthetic pleasure to monetary value? Is there a common value currency across domains? We use an auction task to assess whether people use a consistent value currency for aesthetic, food, and monetary rewards. 

**What is beauty?** Yes, we are going for the elephant question in the room! Most of the big philosophers have tried to define beauty. With the help of the philosopher [Angelica Nuzzo](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/page-elements/academics-research-centers-initiatives/doctoral-programs/philosophy/faculty-bios/angelica-nuzzo), we now compare these definitions to how people experience beauty today and to their beliefs about beauty. So far, we collected data frmom >500 people in the US, UK, and India. Looks like Kant gets a bit of confirmation again...

**Is beauty special?** Or is it just intense pleasure? Many people strongly sense that there is more to beauty than just pleasure - but to date, there is no compelling evidence that this is the case. We will take advantage of a classic psychophysics paradigm - adaptation - to settle this long-standing debate.
