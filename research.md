Why do we like some songs and hate others? Why do we spend money to visit art galleries? Why do we spend so much time binge-watching the latest TV show? My research wants to tackle such questions about the pleasure we take in and the decisions we make based on sensory experiences. To say it in fancy words: The main focus of my research is aesthetic value. My approach to studying beauty is **quantitative** and **computational**.

My PhD thesis encompasses a series of studies on the experience of beauty. My current work follows up on this and takes a more encompassing view both in terms of its subject (going from beauty to aesthetic value broadly conceived) and its methodology (now also incorporating computational neuroscience, machine- and reward-learning perspectives).

I also aim to make my approach **interdisciplinary** by collaborating with philosophers like Joerg Fingerhut and Angelica Nuzzo.

**A computational model of aesthetic value.** Can we build a computational model that predicts what image people want to look at, how long, and at what cost? Well, we think so. Our model is inspired by fluency and predictive coding accounts of aesthetic appreciation. It integrates both views and builds on established reward-learning algorithms. In a nutshell, we suggest that aesthetic value is comprised of two reward components: an immediate one related to how well the current object is processed, and one that is related to the expected increase in how well future objects will be processed.

I am still involved in a few projects with my old lab at NYU, working together with [Maria Pombo](https://twitter.com/mari_pombo?lang=en). We ask: **How much does memory contribute to beauty judgments?** and **When does it matter what objects you saw and rated before?**

**How much would you pay for beauty?** Can we translate aesthetic pleasure to monetary value? Is there a common value currency across domains? We use an auction task to assess whether people use a consistent value currency for aesthetic, food, and monetary rewards. 

**Is beauty special?** Or is it just intense pleasure? Many people strongly sense that there is more to beauty than just pleasure - but to date, there is no compelling evidence that this is the case. We will take advantage of a classic psychophysics paradigm - adaptation - to settle this long-standing debate.
