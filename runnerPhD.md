# Preamble

NaNoWriMo has become a treasured insitution for me over the past years. So far, it has been a very private experience. This year, I will at least allow for the possibility of my little November project to become public. 


## November 1

When the idea of a blogging NaNoWriMo was born, it didn't know how difficult writing would become. When the idea of this blog was young, I thought that it would become a training-log replacement. When the idea of this project was nothing but an idea, I had planned to write about running, and graduating from a PhD program, and how that is tough but amazing at the same time.

Then life happened. It smacked me in my face with an inevitability, a brutality, and a suddenness that left me gasping for air. On the morning of his 65th birthday, my father had a stroke. He dropped on the kitchen floor. His glasses were shattered. I was sitting when my mother told me. I was sitting in the same spot as I do now, and I thought "I'm so glad I'm sitting already." and then "I can't even feel what I am sitting on."

For the past few days, my training log has been lying dormant. My fingers declined to go through the trouble of pressing keys - for what? The last thing I wrote down was this:

> I’m almost hot but numb. I’m sitting in the office with just a T-shirt. When I was moving, I was half-way out of my body, unable to judge what it was doing. It was comforting to have my feet moving, let them take control and my brain shut off a little, or at least let it be with all those weird thoughts while the body operates itself. 

When I wrote this, I felt like the marathon should not matter to me anymore. It seemed ridiculous that my life had revolved around preparing to run 26.2 miles through New York City. Running seemed ridiculous. But then I remembered how excited my Dad had been for me, how he had already downloaded the app that would allow him to track my progress through the five borooughs. 

And then I remembered, too, that we all run for something. That something had just changed. I did not want to run for myself anymore. I want to run for my Dad.
