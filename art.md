# It's not all science
And it's not all coincidence that my science focuses on aesthetics. Ever since I can remember, I have scribbled around on blank surfaces with any pen-like instrument I could find. Life as a postdoc (who also wants to run a few hours per week) sure makes it harder to find time for art, too, but time is made, not found!
