# The Science of Beauty
## The Journey

I was born in Germany, raised in Brussels, went back to Germany to study psychology at the University of Konstanz and currently live in the international chaos of New York city. 

My joint interest in science, the beautiful and the arts have provided me with the somewhat exotic PhD topic of beauty. I am trying to understand this unique experience from a psychological, experimental and quantitative perspective. 

When this humble professional goal does not tie me to my laptop, I let my thoughts wander on long runs through Brooklyn and Manhattan. And when my feet are tired from that, or from dancing, I try to pull out my sketchbook in memory of past desires to attend art school.

## Research

My approach to studying beauty is **quantitative** and **computational**. The main goal of my PhD is to develop a mathematical working model of the processes underlying an experience of beauty.

I also aim to make my approach interdisciplinary by collaborating with philosophers at the Einstein Group in Berlin
